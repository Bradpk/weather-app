### Weather App

This project is a weather app that retrieves weather data based on a user-entered zip code using an API. It displays the city name, temperature in both Fahrenheit and Celsius, weather condition, humidity, and barometric pressure. To add a visual element, the app dynamically renders a moving background that corresponds to the weather condition from the provided zip code.
